> [!NOTE]
> Source files of my first REDkit mod which was initially made as a joke and ended up with people actually enjoying it, in case someone wants to build upon it since I probably won't, here lies the files modified by my mod.

## Installation

* Create a new REDkit project
* Download the files and paste the `workspace` folder inside your newly created project folder
* Startup your project and open your `Asset Browser`
* Search for `q403_01_teleport_to_kaer_morhen.w2scene` which will now be its modified version that you can build upon
