# Don't Let Triss Ruin It

Are you tired of that pesky redhead going around ruining your wholesome family reunion? No? Well that doesn't matter because now you have the chance to experience the family reuniting without Triss ruining the moment for you!

> [!NOTE]
> Source files of my first [REDkit mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9042) which was initially made as a joke and ended up with people actually enjoying it, in case someone wants to build upon it since I probably won't, here lies the files modified by my mod.

## ðŸ“– Installation

* Create a new REDkit project
* Download the files and paste the `workspace` folder inside your newly created project folder
* Startup your project and open your `Asset Browser`
* Search for `q403_01_teleport_to_kaer_morhen.w2scene` which will now be its modified version that you can build upon
